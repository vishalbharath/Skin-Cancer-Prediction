## Introduction

Skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. This project leverages deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to analyze and classify images of skin lesions to predict whether they are benign or malignant.

## Features

- **Image Preprocessing**: Techniques like resizing, normalization, and augmentation to enhance model performance.
- **Modeling**: Implementation of CNNs and other deep learning architectures for image classification.
- **Transfer Learning**: Utilizing pre-trained models like VGG16, ResNet, or Inception for improved accuracy.
- **Evaluation**: Model assessment using accuracy, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrices.
- **Visualization**: Visualizing training progress, model performance, and prediction results.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vishalbharath/Skin-cancer-prediction-.git
    ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required packages**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Data

The dataset should contain images of skin lesions categorized into different classes (e.g., `benign` and `malignant`). Ensure the data is split into training, validation, and testing sets. Public datasets like the ISIC archive can be used for this purpose.

## Model Training

The model is trained on the preprocessed image data using deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The training process involves fine-tuning hyperparameters and experimenting with different architectures to achieve optimal performance.

## Evaluation

Model performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrices. The results are saved in the `results/` directory for further analysis.

## Results

The results, including performance metrics and visualizations of the model's predictions, are stored in the `results/` directory. These insights help in understanding the model's strengths and areas for improvement.
